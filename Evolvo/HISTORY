0.7d - Whoops. Compiled 0.7c with Java 1.5 compiler, doesn't run on 1.4 
		 JVMs, even though no 1.5 features were used. Recompiled using -target
		 and -source 1.4.

0.7c - Whoops. 0.7 doesn't actually work.

0.7 - Added vectors. Lots and lots of bug fixes.

0.6 - Added TiledImage to handle very large images. This does not mix well with 
      the QuickTime exporter, which currently only works with the old AWT style
      Image class. Also, requires a 1.4 JVM. To keep things going on OS X (which
      is still stuck with a 1.3 JVM), Evolvo will automatically use a 1.3-
      compatible image class on a 1.3 JVM. This class cannot handle very large
      images very well.
      
      Also a few little bug fixes.

0.5 - Replaced old ImageGenerator stuff with a more robust implementation based
      on Java's image producer/consumer model.  Made names of packages and classes
      compliant with the Java coding guidelines.  Now works correctly on OS X (at
      least on the two OS X machines I've tried it on).  

0.3 - Lots of little fixes from 0.2, as well as a new installer and some
      interface changes.

0.2 - Improved performance, new exporter interface, a handful of other internal
      changes.

0.1.1 - Fixed a few usability problems.  Added README and this HISTORY file.

0.1 - Initial release.
