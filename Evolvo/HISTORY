0.5 - Replaced old ImageGenerator stuff with a more robust implementation based
      on Java's image producer/consumer model.  Made names of packages and classes
      compliant with the Java coding guidelines.  Now works correctly on OS X (at
      least on the two OS X machines I've tried it on).  

0.3 - Lots of little fixes from 0.2, as well as a new installer and some
      interface changes.

0.2 - Improved performance, new exporter interface, a handful of other internal
      changes.

0.1.1 - Fixed a few usability problems.  Added README and this HISTORY file.

0.1 - Initial release.
